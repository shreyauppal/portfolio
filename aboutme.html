 <h3>GWC: Girls who Code</h3>
 <p> 1) DJANGO REFLECTION:On July 26, 2017, we experimented with Django;a Python Web framework that does design. We had to follow a set of instructions, Django by Girls; a step by step tutorial that took hours to actually finish. Either way , I enjoyed the company of my good friend, Lisa, who was with me, on my side.                                                                                                                                               
 <p2)2) ADVANCED TOPICS REFLECTION: From August 1st-4th, we stated Advanced Topics; the last topic that we learned as a class
